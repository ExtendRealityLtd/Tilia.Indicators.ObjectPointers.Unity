## Introduction

The Curved Pointer (also known as a Bezier or Parabolic Pointer) casts a curved line from an origin point forward a certain distance and then down until it collides with a collider. The representation of this forward and then downward cast is represented with a bezier curve, which basically plots a curved line between the origin of the beam and the final target point.

When a Curved Pointer is colliding with a valid GameObject, a Selection Action can occur which emits an event containing data about the GameObject that the Curved Pointer is currently colliding with.

The Curved Pointer is a popular choice when creating a teleport locomotion feature as the curved beam always lands on the floor making it easier to choose a destination location.

## Prerequisites

* [Add the Tilia.CameraRigs.SpatialSimulator.Unity -> CameraRigs.SpatialSimulator] prefab to the scene hierarchy.
* [Add the Tilia.Input.UnityInputManager -> Input.UnityInputManager.ButtonAction] prefab to the scene hierarchy.
* [Install the Tilia.Indicators.ObjectPointers.Unity] package dependency in to your [Unity] project.

## Let's Start

### Step 1

Add a `Indicators.ObjectPointers.Curved` prefab to the Unity project hierarchy by selecting `GameObject -> Tilia -> Prefabs -> Indicators -> ObjectPointers -> Indicators.ObjectPointers.Curved` from the Unity main top menu.

### Step 2

The `Follow Source` property on the `Pointer Facade` component determines what GameObject the Pointer should follow in the scene.

If we want the Pointer to follow the Right Controller GameObject then we drag and drop the `CameraRigs.TrackedAlias -> Aliases -> RightControllerAlias` GameObject into the `Follow Source` property on the `Pointer Facade` component within the `Indicators.ObjectPointers.Curved` GameObject.

### Step 3

The Curved Pointer will be deactivated by default so we need a way of activating and deactivating the Pointer beam. This is done by hooking up a `Boolean Action` that will activate the Pointer when it emits `true` and deactivate the Pointer when it emits `false`.

Any `Boolean Action` can be used to perform the activation/deactivation of the Pointer but in this instance we’re going to use the `Input.UnityInputManager.ButtonAction` that is already in the scene. The existing `Boolean Action` will emit `true` when the `Space` key is pressed and will emit `false` when the `Space` key is released.

Drag and drop the `Input.UnityInputManager.ButtonAction` GameObject into the `Activation Action` property on the `Pointer Facade` component.

### Done

We won’t use any of the other `Pointer Facade` properties for now as we have all we need for a Curved Pointer to be activated when the `Space` key is pressed and it will point in a curved line in whatever direction the Right Controller is pointing.

Play the Unity scene and press the `Space` key and the Curved Pointer will emit a beam from the controller pointing in the forward direction of the controller. Notice how the Curved Pointer beam has two states when it is activated:

* `Valid Collision` - The Curved Pointer is colliding with a valid GameObject and displays as a green line.
* `Invalid/No Collision` - The Curved Pointer is not colliding with any valid GameObject and displays as a red line.
