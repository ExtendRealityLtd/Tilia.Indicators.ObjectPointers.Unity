## Introduction

The Object Pointer prefabs provide the ability to indicate a point in world space via different rendered line shapes.

Included line shapes are:

* Straight line
* Curved line

The point in which the indicator is colliding with can then be emitted via a [Unity] event to use that point data for another operation.

> **Requires** the Unity software version `2018.3.10f1` (or above).
